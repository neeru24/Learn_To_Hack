Explaination:
So, we knew that the flag is somewhere in the file, and it is of format `geek{...}`
So, I decided to use grep.

The flag:
`-o` means only matching, like only show the content that matches.
`-E` is used to specify the regular expresssion

So, the command looks like: grep -oE "regex" filename

Regex is: 'geek\{[^}]+\}'

it means, it starts with `geek`, then and escape sequences `\{`.
Then `[^}]` means accept everything in between, except `}`, and `+` means any number of times, for multiple characters.
then it ends with `\}`.
