Command: file

Description:
The `file` command is used to determine the type of a file.
Unlike file extensions, it inspects the file’s content to identify
whether it is a binary, text, executable, image, archive, or script.

This command is extremely useful in CTFs to identify unknown files,
hidden binaries, or misleading file extensions.

Usage:
file [options] <filename>

Common Flags:

- -b
  Prints brief output without the filename.
  Useful when scripting or chaining commands.

- -i
  Displays the MIME type of the file.
  Helpful when dealing with web uploads or content-type analysis.

- -z
  Attempts to look inside compressed files.
  Useful when dealing with .gz or compressed payloads.

- -L
  Follows symbolic links and shows the target file type instead of the link.

- -s
  Reads block or character special files.
  Useful for advanced system analysis.

CTF Use Cases:
- Identify disguised files (e.g., image.png actually being an executable)
- Detect compiled binaries for reverse engineering
- Verify extracted files during forensic analysis

Example:
file suspicious_file
file -i upload.bin
